Bob also knows how to make his own decisions.#
For this he needs a condition.#
The game has a 'while (condition)' loop
while (right_wall) {
...commands
};
Commands will be executed while the condition is true.#
To select this cycle:
The second button, then click 'while'
To select the conditions:
LONG pushing the first button.#

Use while! [1|0][2|0][3|0][4|0][5|0][6|0]#
Go to the next step. <6|3>#
There is also an "if-else" structure.
It's advantage in an alternative solution, if the first condition is not met.#
It looks like this:
if (condition) {
... commands
} else {
...commands
};
