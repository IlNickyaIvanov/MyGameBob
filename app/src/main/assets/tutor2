Now let's learn simple commands of movement...#
To move Bob, you need to enter the command in the field to the right
Or use the "fast printing" buttons.#
Bob big sweet tooth)))
Help him gather all the sweets around. [1|0][0|1][1|2]#
Well done!
In order not to repeat the same command many times, you can use this method:
'right (3);' (In brackets number of steps)#
Now move Bob into the square with the target.
P.S. Do not forget to put ";" After the commands! <6|1> #
Great! It was easy.
Sometimes you need to repeat several commands.
For this (in programming in general), there are cycles.
Try to move Bob to a new target using a loop.#
Cycles in the game look like this:
repeat (number) {
command 1;
command 2;
};
The cycle can be entered manually or with the second button (repeat).
P.S. Do not forget to put ";" After the end of the cycle! <3|4> #
Wow! You did it!
The last step remains. Bob has a new target.
Remember, the shorter the code is - THE BETTER! <0|3> #
