Welcome!
Let's start!#
Before we begin to study Bob's commands, let's look at the buttons...#
The first two buttons on the right are the commands for the "fast printing".
They are convenient to use, but the real pros all print by hand))#
At the bottom there are buttons "*?*", "RE" and "START".
With the help of the first you can repeat the last message of the tutorial.
"RE" is a magic button that will make your code beautiful and understandable))#
You can practice a little.
To continue learning, you need to move Bob into a square with the target...<2|1> #
